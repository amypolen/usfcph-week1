Version Control 
An instantaneous "track changes" that merges multiple people's notes
GIT Verbs: 
Fork: a fork in a road; take pieces of software that have already been developed and when you find software when you want that, you fork it and essentially make a full copy of the code "I want my own copy" 
Clone: when you download a copy of the code from the internet "I want a copy on my computer" 
Commit: Bank button; Any changes to the software is a backup where you can rollback to prior commitments; similar to rolling back to the last save file in a videogame
Push: taking what we made on the computer and send it to the serve
Pull: sending data from the internet 
Branch: Forking from a file on your computer, used to edit code not live, used to test new aspects of your app 
Merge: Taking a branch and merging it back into the tree trunk
Squash merge: No matter how many times you commit, it will merge it as one 
Pull Request + Merge Request

Ecosystem
Developers - what are they?
Front End vs Back End
Front end: anytime you are interacting with something, user interface, visual side that is user is interacting with
Front end types, further broken down > XPlatform, iOS, Android, TV, Wearables like watch, IOT like smartfridge and ring camera, Web, Desktop, Speciality > Design (UI or interior designer and UX or the experience for the user, accessibility) and Logic 
Back end: the engine to the car, how something works actually 
Back end > Security, Data (Databases, AI/ML, APIs), Logic 
Fullstack engineer: can do both of these confidently 

Developers work in teams: 
Quality Assurance people: automated (writing code to test apps) and manual(users manually testing apps)
Business intelligence: Business Analyst+ Product Owner + Project Manager+ Subject Matter Expert(someone who doesn't necessarily code but is experiment on the topic))
Operations: Developer Xperience (people who make apps for developers to optimize) + DataBase Admin + Site Reliability Engineer + Continuously Integrate/Continuously Deliver (getting code to the public/software) 

This course will cover: 
1. GIT + Ecosystem + Getting Started
